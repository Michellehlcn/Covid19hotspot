# covid19hotspot
## Dislaimer
This is my personal work with no affiliation to any organisation. Data was based on the website: hcdc.vn. Since the number of Covid19 cases has seen risen within Hochiminh City and in Vietnam as a whole, the occurrence of a case of infection in the community with a more transmissible variant of SARS-CoV-2 (Delta variant) and opportunities for wide community exposure, I devoted myself to this page in order to help local folks in navigation of hotspots, bringing out any necessary restriction. It is an urgent task and absolutely needs everyone collaboration.

The hotspots have been variously defined as areas of elevated incidence or prevalence, higher transmission efficiency or risk, or higher probability of disease emergence. To define whether that area is a hotspot is a complex matter, however, this map was based on the HCDCâ€™s declaration which ordered the closure of suburbs immediately in order to control transmission and mitigate further spread.
